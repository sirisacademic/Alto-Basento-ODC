# OpenDataBasento

Frontend of the OpenDataBasento project, the platform developed by [SIRIS Academic](http://www.sirisacademic.com) for the Comunit√† Montana Alto Basento aimed to open the access to the available data related to the public procurement of this administration.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To work on the website locally, you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. 

### Installing
Download this repository with Git, then run

```
npm install
```
to install the project's code dependencies.
You can start a local webserver with  start command
```
npm start
```
The website now should be running at http://localhost:3000. This webserver will auto-reaload when you change the Javascript code.

To build the application itself, execute the build command
```
npm build
```
Both commands ```start``` and ```build``` create the environment variable REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT, which get different values whether we create the development or the production version of the app.



## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A javascript library for building user interfaces.
